# Gene-Expression-Project-Example-Code
These are only example codes from the project and not the entire respository for the project, which will be uploaded at a later point. 
Please find a brief description of the existing files below:

CSV_reader takes a group of csv files and registers them into a database.
Brainrender gene visualization generates a visual image of a specific gene's expression pattern in an adult mouse brain.
strict id is an example of a database built and used to implement specific programs.

These programs all require a larger database to run completely and will not work otherwise. These only serve to show an example of the code being developed during this project.
